/*
Pivot and unpivot

Prompt for an AI tool:
Act as a Microsoft T-SQL expert. Table Message has column Category (varchar), Region (varchar), Movement (int).
There are four unique values in the Region column: North, South, East and West
Write the SQL to pivot the table.  
The resulting dataset should have columns: Category, North, South, East and West

Then write the SQL to unpivot the pivoted table back to the original table.
